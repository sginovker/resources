# Steph's Security Resources

## Starting out

How do I learn more about security? How do I get hands on practice outside school/internships?

[TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com)
- I like TryHackMe a lot for starting out from scratch, it doesn't require much programming knowledge and teaches linux basics
- has some great simple explanations for important concepts like networks and TLS

[HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.com)
- better for those who have some knowledge of programming & OS, more challenging than TryHackMe

[Google Gruyere](https://google-gruyere.appspot.com/)
- a vulnerable python application that lets you learn and patch web vulnerabilities in source code
- best for those with good grasp of web application topics and python
- did I mention you can actually patch vulnerabilities in code? very cool

[OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/)
- a vulnerable web app that teaches you the top web vulnerabilities
- beginner friendly

[WeHackPurple](https://community.wehackpurple.com/all-courses)
- videos that give a high-level overview of concepts in application security
- some nice pdfs with lists of common tools used in industry

[PicoCTF](picoctf.org)
- a capture the flag game that is permanently available (not just for a competition)
- great beginner challenges

[Computerphile Youtube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/Computerphile)
- has nice high-level overviews of security topics like password cracking, cryptography, and vulnerabilities like SQL injection

[OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/)
- a beginner-friendly site with CTF challenges


## For everyone
Cool newsletters, podcasts, and communities to learn

- episodes about major security incidents:
    - **19**: Operation Aurora, major 2009 cyberattack against big companies like Google
    - **29**: Stuxnet, 2010 computer worm that damanged Iran's nuclear program
    - **53, 71, 72, 73**: Wannacry, 2017 ransomware attack on Windows

[OWASP foundation](https://owasp.org/)
- has local chapters across the world with talks, networking events, conferences
- focused on application security but has people across many areas in security
- great resources to learn like Juice Shop

## Conferences
most of these have student scholarships available 

[Security BSides](http://www.securitybsides.com/)
- a local security conference hosted in major cities around the world
- probably has a conference near you, happens yearly
- good quality technical talks, good for networking with local employers & cool security people
- big BSides conferences: BSides San Francisco, BSides Las Vegas

[DefCon](https://defcon.org/)
- *the* big annual hacking conference in summer in Las Vegas
- great hands-on workshops, many CTFs, different "village" groups host content on different areas in security (ie Blue Team Village, AppSec Village, etc)

[USENIX conferences](https://www.usenix.org/conferences)

Usually more research and student focused
- Security Symposium
- Symposium on Usable Privacy and Security (SOUPS)
- Enigma

[OWASP Global AppSec US](https://usa.globalappsec.org/)
- also has an annual EU conference

[SANS Summmits](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-summit/)
- free to attend virtually since the pandemic

[PancakesCon](https://pancakescon.com/)
- a casual, virtual beginner-friendly conference

[ReCon](https://recon.cx/)
- held annually in Montreal
- focused on reverse engineering
- expensive

### diversity focused security conferences

[Day of Shecurity](https://www.dayofshecurity.com/)
- pre-pandemic, used to host IRL event in San Francisco annually

[the Diana Initiative](https://www.dianainitiative.org/)
- annually in Las Vegas (& hybrid)
- beginner-friendly events like mentorship, resume workshops, beginner friendly CTF

[WiCyS](https://www.wicys.org/)
- annually in the US (variable location)
- has student chapters across the world

### other more corporate conferences

not very budget friendly, usually aimed at higher level industry leaders. many vendors come to sell their security products to companies. don't recommend going as a student unless it's free:)

[RSA](https://www.rsaconference.com/en)

[SecTor](https://sector.ca/)
- basically BlackHat in Toronto

[BlackHat](https://www.blackhat.com/)
- annually in Las Vegas, right before DefCon

## Final thoughts

it's easy to be overwhelmed with resources and information when starting out; make sure to prioritize what's most important for your goals and manage your time outside school/work so you don't burn out. keep it as simple as possible.

I also acknowledge everyone's learning style is different; I learn best with hands-on and visual resources, so most of my list is hands-on workshops or videos. if you learn best through reading, there are many great lists of books out there on security topics.

top resources I used as a beginner with technical background:
- TryHackMe
- Darknet Diaries podcast
- Computerphile youtube channel
- other students interested in security
